//! # Diplomatic Bag
//! A mechanism for dealing with [`!Send`][`Send`] types when you really need
//! them to be [`Send`].
//!
//! This library provides the [`DiplomaticBag<T>`] type that is [`Send`] and
//! [`Sync`] even if the type it wraps is not. It does this by preventing direct
//! access to the wrapped type but instead provides methods for interacting with
//! it on a thread that it never leaves.
//!
//! This is useful for when you have a [`!Send`][`Send`] type (usually an FFI
//! type) that you need store for a long period of time, and needs to be
//! accessible from multiple threads, for example, in async code.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! # use diplomatic_bag::DiplomaticBag;
//! # use std::{cell::RefCell, rc::Rc};
//! // `Rc` is neither `Send` nor `Sync`
//! let foo = DiplomaticBag::new(|_| Rc::new(RefCell::new(0)));
//!
//! std::thread::spawn({
//!     let foo = foo.clone();
//!     move || {
//!         foo.as_ref().map(|_, rc| {
//!             *rc.borrow_mut() = 1;
//!         });
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//! Now, being able to send an `Rc` around isn't very useful, but this comes in
//! handy when dealing with FFI types that must remain on the same thread for
//! their existence.

/// Another consequence of every bag using the same thread is that no two values
/// can be modified concurrently, essentially sharing a lock on the thread. In
/// general, you should be protected from this; [`run`] and all the methods on
/// this type will detect if they are being run on the worker thread and will
/// avoid "taking the lock", alternatively you can use the [`BaggageHandler`] to
/// wrap and unwrap diplomatic bags safely.

/// the progress of others. All functions block until they have completed
/// executing the closure on the worker thread.
